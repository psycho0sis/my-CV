### Some words about myself: ###  

I'm proposeful chummy person.
I haven't done any programming before, but i dreamed to be a developer since my second course at university.  

Now i'm 28 and i think that everything is possible, so i'll try to do it. I can study lots of information in a short period of time and and i do it every day.  

At the moment I'm improving my hard skills in JavaScript, data structures, algorithms. I try so hard to become more qualified in this stuff.  
Also I improve my English. At the moment I have a B1 level, but my speach isn't fluent enought so it's my big growth point.
